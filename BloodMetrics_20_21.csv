Healthy male adult with apparently cannibalized or predated eggs , only eleven left. Full belly , palpated and could not get him to regurgitate anything. Seems unlikely that he could have eaten the entire clutch in a couple of days. So, predation possible. Also possible that eggs have been kicked out  of the nest since three were found outside the nest.
